# AII-2022
In this repository the codes and the datasets employed for the experimental analysis of the papers written by the members of the NESYA lab for the conference AII-2022  are loaded. 

- AII2022-main: in this folder there is the code employed for the experimental analysis of the submitted and accepted paper "Nonexclusive Classification of Household Appliances by Fuzzy Deep Neural Networks" 
- AII2022-2-c-main:in this folder there is the code used for the experimental analysis of the submitted and accepted paper "Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder by a Fast Deep Neural Network". In particular the dataset used for this experimental analysis, was too heavy to be loaded on git, for this reason feel free to send an email to nesyalab@gmail.com to access the entire dataset. The network code is still runnable because the .npy files have been loaded into the folder. For this reason, for training and inference refer to the code model.ipynb
